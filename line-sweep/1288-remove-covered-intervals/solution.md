## Problem:

Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. Interval [a,b) is covered by interval [c,d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.

After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
```
